# ewd
ewd is a simple worker queue for asynchronous background tasks.

## Synopsis
ewd is a job queue and worker management system. Queues are declared in a crontab-like file along with the maximum number of concurrent workers and the command the workers will run.

	$ cat /etc/ewd.conf
	#name max cmd
	images 5 /usr/local/bin/process_images
	stats 6 /usr/local/bin/generate_stats

Jobs in ewd are simply a list of arguments to pass to the command. Jobs can be added to the queue using a simple ASCII format, specifying the queue followed by the command arguments.

	$ echo "images --image test.jpg --format png --size=1024x768" | nc ewd.foo.com 8277
